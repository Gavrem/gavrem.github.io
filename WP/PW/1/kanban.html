<ul>
	<li>First, we created all the tasks. Then share roles and tasks between
	us in order to have an equal amount of work. </li>
	
	<li>We could see all tasks on the table under the heading: To do, Doing, and Done.
	If another member has a task in “To do” that needs the other team member’s task to be done.
 It waits for that. Team member starts another task from “To do”.  That helped us to
 use our time more efficiently.</li>
	<li>Diving tasks under their categories gives flexibility 
	to all team members to plan their schedules according to their
	own terms as long as they meet the requirement by the kanban table.</li>
	<li>When a task is “Done” other team member review it and gave	 feedback.</li>
	<li> We were advancing incremental changes, that helped to build up 
	the project with a fundamental basis.</li>
	<li>We set the due date according to the project to end in 10 days.
	Coordinating the project with kanban helped us to meet our goal and 
	finish the project before the deadline.</li>
