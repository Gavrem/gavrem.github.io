                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p>There's a world of choice in today's car market, what with more
				than 400 different models and many car types available. Making sense 
				of it all can be difficult. What are the different types of cars?
				The first thing to know is that "cars" means "passenger vehicles 
				of all types." For the purposes of keeping it simple, we've broken
				down all of those vehicle choices into three major categories covering 
				all of the basic types of vehicles from coupes to full-size sedans
				to crossover SUVs.<br/></p>
				
				<p>Our mission is to create an platform where people can find information about type of cars so that they can
				dedice which is suit thier needs before buying.				</p>
